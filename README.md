| `dark`      | `#002d3d` |
| `success`      | `#43d678` |
| `error`      | `#e3282A` |
| `darker-primary`      | `#23307a` |
| `inactive-primary`      | `rgba(71, 90, 170, 0.4)` |

| `outline-white`      | `#c4c4c4` |
| `outline-dark`      | `#000000` |
| `outline-success`      | `#a2f0b3` |
| `outline-error`      | `#ff7387` |
| `transparent` | `-` |

These colors extend the built-in colors in tailwind. \
Built-in colors and arbitary color values can also be used. [For more information.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)

#### Max Width

```html
    <div class="mx-vw-full mx-vh-full">
        ...
    </div>
```
| Options   | Size (CSS units) | 
| :-------- | :------- |  
| `mx-vw-full` | `100vw` | 
| `mx-vh-full`      | `100vh` |

The only reason that these are here is because to extends the max-width \
option from what tailwind has to offer already. \
Might come in handy.
